## Project Background
Research consistently shows a positive correlation between access to urban greenery or nature and improved mental health. 
Studies have shown that people living in areas with more green spaces tend to report higher levels of overall well-being
- Reduced stress and anxiety
- Improved mood
- Enhanced cognitive function
- Physical activity promotion

By combining environmental and mental health data, this project seeks to highlight how urban greenery can be a low-cost, 
natural intervention for improving mental wellbeing. Data-driven insights can help Policy makers, city planners, and mental health specialists to make informed decisions to foster healthier, greener, and more resilient urban communities. Therefore, the objective of this project is to evaluating the effectiveness of Urban Greenery in Singapore.
- Analyzing tree canopy distribution across neighborhoods to determine whether greenery is equitably distributed
- Assessing correlations between green cover and socio-demographic factors to identify disparities
- Providing insights for urban planners to optimize green spaces for public mental health benefits

## AI Ethics
Several ethical considerations were identified in this project:
-Privacy: Ensuring that no personally identifiable information (PII) is included in the dataset, particularly if integrating satellite or street-level imagery.
- Fairness: Avoiding biases in clustering results that could disproportionately impact specific regions or communities.
- Accuracy: Ensuring that the model's clustering outcomes align with real-world observations to prevent misleading conclusions.
- Accountability: Clearly documenting data sources and clustering methodologies to allow stakeholders to validate findings.
- Transparency: Making clustering results and their implications accessible to urban planners, policymakers, and the public to support informed decision-making.
